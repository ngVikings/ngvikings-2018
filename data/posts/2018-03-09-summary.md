## Hello, dear Angular Viking!

We have so many things to share with you :)

At first, thank you very much! For your trust (it's always challenging to start a new conference in the new country), for your passion, for your positive and friendly attitude during all the conference. You are just the best attendees ever!

## Statistics

* This year we had 330 participants including 48 speakers/trainers
* 55% of the participants came to Finland from the different parts of the world (we are a truly international community!)

## Feedback
We received so much positive feedback on Twitter and Slack. This is something that inspires us to organize next ngVikings. Also, we want to provide a better participants experience each year. This is why it's very important for us to get more structured feedback. Based on the last year's survey we improved lots of things, and we kindly ask you spend a couple of minutes to fill in this year's feedback form. Most of the fields are not obligatory, just [fill what you want to fill](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWnLc7JXiHEMV_U2EPkz3pqUj5F82WbHOhdi8-KpnrTRctvw/viewform). 

Thanks in advance!

## Videos and Photos

ngVikings is about sharing.

* We are happy to share 43 videos (20 hours of Angular) on YouTube. Please [subscribe to our channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ngVikings)
* We have hundreds of official photos on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ngVikings/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1749532581802652) and many more albums of the [photos taken by crew and attendees](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ngVikings/photos/?tab=albums). Have a look at the uncountable number of smiles and mark yourself on photos :)

## Sponsors
ngVikings is non-profit, non-commercial event which is fully depending on the support of the local and international companies. All the companies listed [here](https://ngvikings.org/sponsors/) deserve honor and respect as the true dev community contributors. Thank you!

## What's next?
We definitely want ngVikings 2019 to happen in some form in some country :) Where do we sail? We are open to the discussion! If you think that your country is a good fit for the conference dedicated to Angular and its ecosystem in the February-March of 2019, just [drop us a message](contact@ngvikings.org) It could be any European country with the strong Angular community but without a large Angular conference. We could come and organize the one for you. We are keen on having both local speakers and inviting international experts, and we love to hold the events in the universities!

As a participant of ngVikings 2018 you will know about our plans first!

We really want to see you all again!

Yours, Maxim Salnikov  
on behalf of ngVikings team
