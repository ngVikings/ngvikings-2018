## Scholarship Program


ngVikings is an event organized by and for the community, and it’s important to us that all members of the community should be included, also those who would normally be unable to attend for financial reasons. We’re very happy to be able to offer The Scholarship Program (inspired by the one from Web Rebels and Mobile Era conferences) to offer financial aid to people from underrepresented groups wanting to attend the conference.

## Eligibility
We aim to help underrepresented groups in Tech to attend to our conference. Therefore scholarships are primarily intended to assist people from groups traditionally underrepresented in the local developer community, including women, people of non-Scandinavian descent, LGBTQIA+ people and people with disabilities. However, we wouldn't presume to be able to provide a complete list of underrepresented groups, so all applications will be considered. Eligibility ultimately depends on the discretion of the selection committee.

## Selection
All applications will be reviewed by the selection committee, and will be accepted at their discretion, although selection will primarily favor diversity concerns and financial need. All information provided to the committee will be kept strictly confidential.

## Award
Selected applicants will receive a fully paid ticket for the conference.

## How do I apply?
Just fill in the form. Deadline for the application: **Saturday 10th February, 23:59**.
