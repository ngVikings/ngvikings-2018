We are happy to announce that as a result of partnership with Aalto University, we have changed the location of our conference to Dipoli conference center. 

Dipoli is located in Espoo, Finland. Espoo is part of the Helsinki metropolitan region, the second largest city in Finland, home of the biggest technical university of the country, and has a vibrant start-up community. Dipoli is easily reachable with metro from Helsinki city centre. So if you are travelling from outside of Finland, you still need to fly to Helsinki Airport.

**Address:** [Otakaari 24, 02150 Espoo, Finland](https://goo.gl/maps/hsozfWzWv772)
