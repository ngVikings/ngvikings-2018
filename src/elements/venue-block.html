              ## How to get to the Venue?

              #### From Helsinki center:

              Otaniemi campus area is best reached using the newly opened “Aalto Yliopisto” metro station. As Helsinki metro consists of a single line, there is no major risks of getting lost. Dipoli is in a walking distance from the metro station.

              #### By Taxi:

              Finnish taxis are reliable and clean. The fees are mandated by government and taxi meter is always used. The fee is relatively high. You can pay with the common credit cards in taxis. Taxis can be booked by calling to **0100 7000 (Helsinki)** or **0100 7070 (Espoo)**. There is a taxi rank and plenty of cars in Helsinki-Vantaa airport.

              ## Travel Ticket

              Metro, trains, trams, and buses have the same ticketing system. There are different prices for intra-city transit and transit between cities in Helsinki metropolitan region. Otaniemi is part of city of Espoo and thus you need to buy a regional ticket when coming from Helsinki. Also Helsinki-Vantaa airport is located in Vantaa, and again you need to buy a **regional ticket** to get to Helsinki.

              The recommended way to buy the ticket is from [HSL mobile ticket application](https://www.hsl.fi/en/mobileticket) ([Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsl.mobiililippu), [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/hsl-mobiililippu/id1078566902), [Windows Phones](https://www.microsoft.com/fi-fi/store/p/hsl-mobiililippu/9nblggh1ndz7?rtc=1)), and it is cheaper than ticket machines or from bus driver!

              For more information about the tickets, please check [https://www.hsl.fi/en/tickets-and-fares](https://www.hsl.fi/en/tickets-and-fares) and for routing, use [https://www.reittiopas.fi/](https://www.reittiopas.fi/).

              ## About Finland

              * Main languages are Finnish, English. Check out our brief guide to Finnish in order to surprise the locals. We use euro as our currency.

              * Finland is generally considered a safe country. Do not try to go past people in the grill queue, through, as that's a common way to find yourself in a trouble.

              * Some Finns don't like if you tell them Finland is a part of Scandinavia. Technically a small part in the north is but some consider Finland as a culturally separate entity. The more inclusive term to use might be fennoscandia (Finland and the rest).

              * You can read a bit about Finland and Helsinki at this fresh and often updated site: [http://www.visitfinland.com](http://www.visitfinland.com)
